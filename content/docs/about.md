Hi! I'm documenting my learning note about machine learning on this blog. I'm particularly interested in generative models, diffusion models, and recommender systems. Besides, I work as an ML research engineer at [Haiper](https://haiper.ai/), where I train large-scale video generation models. I'm also a big fan of film photography and love to travel.
